## Challenges
### Technical Challenge
Implementing the advanced search and filter functionality was particularly challenging. To solve this, I used a combination of React’s state management and JavaScript’s array methods to filter data dynamically. Optimizing performance using debounce techniques was crucial to reduce unnecessary re-renders.

### Non-Technical Challenge
Balancing the project with other commitments was a significant challenge. By creating a detailed project plan and using tools like Trello for tracking progress, I managed to stay on schedule and complete the project on time.

## Future Improvements
- **User Reviews and Ratings:** Allow users to leave reviews and rate wheels.
- **Backend Integration:** Handle user authentication and order processing.
- **Additional Filters:** Introduce more detailed filter options for a better search experience.
